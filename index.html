                <img src="images/AllSystemsRed-Murderbot.jpg" alt="Book cover of All Systems Red by Martha Wells">
                <p class="li_audiobooks">This Sci-Fi novella was released in 2017 and details the diary entries of a
                    cyborg security unit tasked with protecting it's human clients on a dangerous planet. The book is a
                    part of a larger collection aptly named 'The Murderbot Diaries' and centers around the titular
                    cyborg gaining it's own independence and discovering what purpose in existence it would prefer to
                    pursue. Through meeting new humans, and eventually having to save many of them, it develops into a
                    remarkable entity and explores the aspects of being human that it was never allowed to consider
                    before. This book particularly struck me because the titular character explores the human experience
                    through the lens of an artificial entity that is equiped with human-tissue components along with
                    it's cybernetic machinery. This book is also likely to resonate with individuals who are
                    neurodivergent, such as Autistic or ADHD diagnosed individuals. I enjoyed the subversion of the
                    trope where a human learns how to adjust to new robotic components for their bodies by presenting
                    the human tissue as the 'foreign element' in the normal robotic system. I believe this approach
                    helps express the experiences of neurodivergent people very well.</p>

                <img src="images/GhostInTheShell-StandAloneComplex.jpg"
                    alt="TV series cover of the 'Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex' series">
                <p class="li_tvshows">This classic series was created after the first 'Ghost in the Shell' movie was
                    released to the public and continues the story of Major Motoko Kusanagi, an almost fully prosthetic
                    cyborg with only her brain remaining human. She works for a fictional organization called Public
                    Security Section 9 in a futuristic Japan. This world explores the concepts of defining the human
                    experience when so much of the human body can be replaced with robotic components. The series also
                    explores an interpretation of how corporate entities gain enough influence to be almost on par with
                    governmental organizations and the struggle of the populace to exist in this semi-distopic setting.
                    The story for this series covers an high-expertise level hacker attempting to uncover corporate
                    secrets and reveal them to the public with Section 9 attempting to uncover the bigger picture hidden
                    underneath the investigation. I classify this as a good series to introduce someone wanting to
                    explore the concept of cyberization and technology becoming a feature of the human body.</p>

                <h3 class="li_audiobooks">Audiobook: "Into the Labyrinth" by John Bierce&nbsp;<img></h3>
                <img src="images/IntoTheLabyrinth-MageErrant.jpg" alt="Book cover of Into the Labyrinth by John Bierce">
                <p class="li_audiobooks">This audibook is the first in a series called 'Mage Errant' that is based off
                    of the works of John Bierce. This is a Fantasy story that introduces readers/listeners to a world
                    filled with magic, dragons, adventure, and of course, labyrinths. The series offers a unique
                    presentation of how magic could function in a universe when the magic system uses a basis of
                    scientific principles to create a foundation for how the magic operates in the world. The magic
                    doesn't simply change reality based on a spell, it requires the caster, and thereby the reader, to
                    comprehend the scientific principles underlying the universe-when mages cast fire spells, the spell
                    is affected by humidity, heat tolerance, the flamability of an object, and so on to properly work. I
                    was particularly drawn to the series also portraing neurodivergence in an approachable manner
                    without reducing those references to the trope of 'the special disable child'. The series also
                    presents various social, political, and philosophical topics for it's readers to consider through a
                    very approachable perspective. It respects the reader's intelligence for the topics covered and
                    balances the technical/intellectual aspects with plenty of magical combat.</p>
